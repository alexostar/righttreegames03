        Forestry in Iceland is currently undergoing a profound transformation in
        terms of scale, methods, and objectives. The international voluntary
        carbon market is showing growing interest in harnessing Iceland’s
        potential for carbon capture projects.

        Over a millennium ago, when humans first settled in Iceland, it is
        estimated that birch forest and shrublands covered 20-40% of the land.
        The Book of Icelanders paints a picture of a landscape covered with wood
        from the mountains to the sea. The settlers burned woodlands to
        establish grazing areas and to make charcoal for fuel. Over the
        centuries vulnerable soils, sheep grazing, volcanic activities and
        colder climate resulted in a more or less treeless land, vegetation
        atrophy and eroded soils.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Iceland, apart from the juniper shrub, there are no native coniferous
        species. Native tree and shrub species are birch, willow and rowan.
        Forestry involving non-native species has been conducted since the dawn
        of last century, initially on a relatively modest scale. A majority of
        Icelanders are in favour of forestry and there are local forestry
        associations in most Icelandic communities.

        Forestry in Iceland is currently undergoing a profound transformation in
        terms of scale, methods, and objectives. The international voluntary
        carbon market is showing growing interest in harnessing Iceland’s
        potential for carbon capture projects. As a result, new stakeholders are
        entering the arena, and the state Forest Service anticipates a sevenfold
        increase in the annual allocation of land areas for forestry in the near
        future.

        The 2019 Forestry Act required preparation of a 10-year forestry
        strategy. The appointed ministerial committee did not reach consensus.
        The majority favoured a vast increase of coniferous tree planting, using
        Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine and larch species, as well as the
        non-native Black cottonwood.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was opposed by many individuals from the academic, scientific and
        environmental and cultural heritage communities who eventually founded
        an NGO called Friends of Icelandic Nature. The main objective of the NGO
        is to promote a better ecosystems approach to forestry in Iceland and to
        apply a precautionary principle when it comes to use of non-native
        species.
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2022, a new combined strategy for forestry and soil
        conservation was published including as a guiding principle to promote
        the protection, development and integrity of ecosystems based on an
        ecosystems approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        A large part of Icelandic nature has little or no protection from the
        impacts of forestry. The Friends of Icelandic Nature regard the current
        forestry plans for carbon capturing as being a serious threat to
        biological diversity and bird life, cultural and geological heritage and
        the unique open Icelandic landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on raising awareness of the risk of using non-native species
        because of the significant impact they will have on the Icelandic nature
        and landscape in the coming decades when planted at the foreseen scale.
        Generally, our members acknowledge that forestry comes with various
        advantages, but it also comes with a significant downside. Forestry has
        to be planned with great care, considering the long term effects, and
        honouring precautionary principles. Wide consultation is essential to
        live up to the emphasis of the government strategy on an ecosystem
        approach. Our motto is Right tree in the right place.

        Iceland or stop there during migration. Six responsibility species will
        be severely affected by land changes associated with extensive forestry.

      <h2 className='text-2xl'>Carbon forestry</h2>
      <p>
        Over recent years several actors in Iceland have offered tree planting
        to companies and individuals (including tourists) to compensate for
        their carbon footprint. There is an increasing awareness in Iceland that
        buying these carbon offsets can be regarded as ‘green washing’ – a view
        that was recently supported by the Forest Service. The projects are not
        certified and the calculation of a neutral carbon footprint is based on
        offsetting a time limited carbon footprint with the amount that the
        trees will possibly capture during their 50-60 years lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forest Service launched a set of requirements for carbon capture
        projects in 2022, making Icelandic forestry projects more attractive to
        the voluntary carbon market. The first project was certified against
        these requirements at the end of 2022. The standard addresses the
        green-washing nature of earlier uncertified projects: the carbon units
        cannot be used to offset carbon release until after measurements show
        that the carbon has really been captured. The initiative is drastically
        changing the scale of funding from the voluntary carbon market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Friends of Icelandic nature are opposed to many current and planned
        carbon capturing projects and claim that the Forest Service requirements
        do not provide sufficient guarantees for wide consultation, assessment
        of environmental risks and protection of biodiversity. The NGO also
        claims that the estimate of the amount of captured carbon does not take
        into account possible changes in soil carbon. We also find the
        additionality of the carbon capturing projects to be questionable when
        compared to the carbon capturing potential of a restored natural
        ecosystems. Furthermore, the fraction of the captured carbon that will
        be permanently removed from the atmosphere will certainly be much lower
        than in natural ecosystems.

        The forest and soil conservation services will be merged on 1 January
        2024, providing an opportunity to change the direction of forestry
        towards an ecosystems approach.
